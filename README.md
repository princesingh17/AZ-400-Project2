# Project 2 â€“ Azure Virtual Machine Monitoring

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project was implemented to monitor Azure Virtual Machines hosting critical services for Skill-up Technologies.  
Azure Monitor was configured to track key performance metrics and send proactive alerts for issue detection.

## âœ… Project Implementation

### **1. Resource Group & VM Deployment**
- Created a dedicated Resource Group.
- Deployed a VM (Windows/Linux) with free-tier eligible size (B1s/B1ls) and configured username/password.

### **2. Azure Monitor Configuration**
- Enabled performance data collection for CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics.

### **3. Metrics Monitoring**
- Accessed real-time performance data in the Metrics section.
- Adjusted time range and interval for detailed analysis.

### **4. Alerts Setup**
- Configured alert rules for CPU usage thresholds.
- Created an Action Group to send email notifications.
- Verified costs stayed within the Azure free-tier.

### **5. Testing**
- Simulated high CPU usage.
- Confirmed alerts triggered and email notifications were received successfully.
